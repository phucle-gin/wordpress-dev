Martin's Movies WordPress Setup

### Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd martins-movies
Set Up WordPress

### Create a new database for WordPress.

Rename wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php.

Update wp-config.php with your database credentials:

php
Copy code
define( 'DB_NAME', 'your_database_name' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'your_database_user' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'your_database_password' );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
Install Dependencies

If using Composer or npm for managing dependencies, install them:
bash
Copy code
composer install  # For Composer
npm install       # For npm

### Configure Environment:
	
	Configure Apache or Nginx to serve the WordPress site. Set the document root to the martins-movies directory.
		
	Set up a folder for the new project in the /var/www directory. To do that through CLI, open terminal and type:
		cd /var/www
		sudo mkdir example
		Where ‘example’ is the project name. Then do:
		sudo chown $USER:$USER example
		cd example
		mkdir logs
			
		git clone <SSH_URL_FROM_GITHUB_FOR_THE_PROJECT> public_html
		The full path of this dir should be ‘/var/www/example/public_html’.

	Create a virtual host file:
		From terminal type:
		cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
		sudo touch example.local.conf
		sudo gedit example.local.conf

	<VirtualHost *:80>
	
		ServerName example.local
		ServerAlias www.example.local
		ServerAdmin webmaster@example.local
		DocumentRoot /var/www/example/public_html
	
		<Directory /var/www/example/public_html>
			Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
			AllowOverride All
			Order allow,deny
			allow from all
		</Directory>
	
	    <FilesMatch \.php$>
	        # From the Apache version 2.4.10 and above, use the SetHandler to run PHP as a fastCGI process server, you can choose your preferred version 
	        #SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php5.6-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost"
			#SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost"
			#SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost"
			SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost"
			#SetHandler "proxy:unix:/run/php/php8.0-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost"
	
		From terminal activate the virtual host file:
		sudo a2ensite example.local
		    
	Configure your hosts file: 
		sudo nano /etc/hosts
		Add 127.0.0.1 example.local
			    

Achieved
- [x] Build a new paginated listing page to pull all data
- [x] Responsiveness and Overall Design
- [ ] Search Function by Keyword.

Limitation and Takeouts:
- Limitations:
	API Rate Limits: The Movie Database (TMDb) API has rate limits that may affect the number of requests you can make within a certain timeframe. Ensure your caching strategy (set_transient and get_transient) helps mitigate excessive API calls.
	Pagination Limitations: You're limiting the pagination to 500 pages (min($api_response['total_pages'], 499)). This should be sufficient for most practical purposes, but consider the scalability if the number of pages increases significantly.
	Search Functionality: The search functionality (search/movie) in TMDb API is straightforward but may have limitations in terms of search accuracy and handling complex queries. Consider how well it performs with various types of keywords and search conditions.
	Imdb_id Retrieval: You're caching IMDb IDs (get_movie_imdb_id) to reduce API requests. Ensure the cache duration (86400 seconds or 24 hours) balances freshness with performance.
	Error Handling: While you handle errors in fetching movies (is_wp_error and API errors), ensure robust error logging and user feedback to diagnose and troubleshoot issues effectively.

- Takeaways:
	Performance Considerations: Use caching (set_transient and get_transient) effectively to reduce API calls and improve application responsiveness.	
	Security: Ensure nonce validation (check_ajax_referer) in AJAX requests (fetch_movies) to prevent unauthorized access and potential security vulnerabilities.	
	Scalability: Consider how well the application handles large datasets and traffic spikes. Evaluate if the current pagination and data fetching strategy can scale efficiently.	
	User Experience: Enhance the user interface with meaningful feedback (No movies found. messages) and responsive design (fetchPageData function).
	The current implementation may not be production-ready due to certain limitations. However, it is presented here as a showcase for discussion during a sprint or phase review. Further refinement and optimization are needed before deployment in a production environment.
